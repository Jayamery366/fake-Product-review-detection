Title: Fake Review Detection using Machine Learning

Abstract:
The rise of e-commerce and online services has led to an increase in fake reviews, which can mislead consumers and harm businesses. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fake reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. The dataset used consists of customer reviews labeled as real or fake, and the model is trained to classify them accurately.

1. Introduction
Online reviews significantly influence consumer decisions. However, the prevalence of fake reviews necessitates automated detection methods. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, and Scikit-Learn to preprocess text data and build a classification model.

2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a "Fake Reviews Dataset," which includes the following columns:

Category: Type of review

Rating: User-provided rating

Label: Indicates whether a review is fake (OR) or genuine (CG)

Text_: The actual review text

3. Data Preprocessing
To improve model accuracy, the text data undergoes preprocessing:

Lowercasing: Converts text to lowercase.

Removing special characters: Eliminates non-alphabetic characters.

Tokenization: Splits text into words.

Stopword removal: Filters out common words (e.g., "the," "and").

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical form.

4. Model Implementation
A Logistic Regression model is trained using the TF-IDF vectorized text data. The dataset is split into training (87%) and testing (13%) sets using stratified sampling.

5. Results and Evaluation
The model achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, with the following performance metrics:

Precision: 0.89 for CG and 0.88 for OR

Recall: 0.87 for CG and 0.89 for OR

F1-score: 0.88 for both categories

6. Conclusion
The project successfully builds a machine learning model to detect fake reviews with high accuracy. Future improvements could include using deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers for better text classification.
